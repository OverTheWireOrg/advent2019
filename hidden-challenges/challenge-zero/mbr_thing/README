TL;DR: Fairly basic AES stuff crammed into an MBR

If you want a fully non-spoilers experience, just look at boot.bin and stop

How to run:

qemu-system-x86_64 -hda boot.bin -cpu max


If you want to run it on real hardware, AES-NI must be supported!

(As-is, it fails silently if AES-NI support is not present...)
