  <h2>You've been a naughty elf</h2>

<div>
  <p style="">If you are here you have been a bad, bad elf. This holiday season,
  Santa has implemented a <strong>NO UNION</strong> policy in order to stay
  competitive with the likes of Amazon and AliExpress. We cannot afford to lose
  our competitive advantage due to your collective bargaining.</p>
  <p>Since you were caught attempting to participate in union related activities,
  you have been placed on a list for bad elves. Once on this list your Christmas
  related privileges have been revoked with immediate effect and you are now
  under a period of probation.</p>
  <p>In order to get off of this list, you will have to accumulate enough
  credits to show you are willing to participate in Christmas with the proper
  amount of Christmas spirit. Credits can be purchased with your hard earned
  gingerbread tokens in order to speed up your probation otherwise you will get
  a reduced wage of <strong>1</strong> gingerbread token per Christmas season (held in escrow).
  Once you have <strong>5000</strong> tokens, you can resume normal activities.</p>
  <p>Failure to meet these minimum demands will result in your entry to a
  re-education camp.</p>
