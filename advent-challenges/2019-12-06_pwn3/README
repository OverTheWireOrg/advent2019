The goal of this challenge is to mutate up to 4 of the binary 'elf'
so that when executed, will be able to reveal the contents of
flag.txt to you.

Playtest:
 - `python chal.py` would be the exposed service you interact with
 - The player has access to the `elf` binary.
 - The player does not have access to the source code, but it really
   does not matter for playtesting. It provides no additional
   information, other than making the storyline less coherent for the
   player. (The storyline so far is you're supposed to correct the
   mutations in the lyrics, but of course, correcting those bytes
   would not give you the flag.)
